        <h2>Hoses</h2>
    <div class="para1">A hose is a flexible hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another. Hoses are also sometimes called pipes (the word pipe usually refers to a rigid tube, whereas a hose is usually a flexible one), or more generally tubing. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical (having a circular cross section).Hose design is based on a combination of application and performance. Common factors are size, pressure rating, weight, length, straight hose or coilhose, and chemical compatibility.A hose is a flexible hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another.

        <h2>Racks</h2>
        <div class="para2">A rack, also referred to as racking, is a structural design made of steel which consists of frames and connectors for storing goods in the warehouses or storage facilities. The rack is assembled by welding, bolting or clipping. Generally, it is known to be one of the fundamental tools in material handling industry.A rack, also referred to as racking, is a structural design made of steel which consists of frames and connectors for storing goods in the warehouses or storage facilities.

        <h2>Shovels</h2>
        <div class="para3">A shovel is a tool used for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials, such as soil, coal, gravel, snow, sand, or ore.[1Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle. Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong. Shovel handles are usually made of wood (especially specific varieties such as ash or maple) or glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass).Hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle. This fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade. The handles are usually riveted in place. A T-piece is commonly fitted to the end of the handle to aid grip and control where the shovel is designed for moving soil and heavy materials. These designs can all be easily mass-produced.A shovel is a tool used for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials, such as soil, coal, gravel, snow, sand, or ore.[1Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle.
